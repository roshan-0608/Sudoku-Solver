# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective of the puzzle is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle starts with some cells already filled with numbers, which serves as a constraint on the possible solutions. The difficulty of the puzzle depends on the number of pre-filled cells and the arrangement of these numbers.

## Sudoku Rules

A valid Sudoku solution must satisfy **all** of the following rules:

1. **Row Constraint**:  
   Each of the digits **1 to 9** must occur **exactly once** in each **row**.

2. **Column Constraint**:  
   Each of the digits **1 to 9** must occur **exactly once** in each **column**.

3. **Sub-grid Constraint**:  
   Each of the digits **1 to 9** must occur **exactly once** in each of the **nine 3Ã—3 sub-boxes** of the grid.
